                            If somebody would have told me last week that I would be making a website 
                            for a <br/> programming portfolioI wouldn't have believe them.
                            A couple days ago I came <br/> across this app called <a href = "https://getmimo.com"><em>Mimo</em></a>.
                            The app teaches you simple programming lessons <br/>on your phone. 
                            Thanks to the app I was able to learn enough HTML/CSS to make 
                            this website.

                    <p>
                            I am a recent college graduate and I'm seeking an entry level position <br> 
                            for software engineering, web developing or IT Support. This will allow <br>
                            me to utilize my programing, analytical and troubleshooting skills to <br> 
                            further develop my abilities in the field of computer science. <br>
